## About Me 📚

Hi, I’m Joshua—a junior at Northwestern University pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a minor in Economics. My interests span back-end software development, data analytics, and the intersection of AI with education and healthcare. I’ve worked on impactful projects like SomethingSold, a college-specific marketplace, and I’m actively exploring how AI can enhance teaching and curriculum development through my research with the VILA pipeline.

My passion for computer science stems from a love for problem-solving and creative thinking. Whether it’s building scalable back-end systems, crafting predictive models, or tackling real-world challenges through software, I thrive on opportunities to combine technical expertise with an analytical, data-driven approach. I’m always eager to learn, collaborate, and contribute to meaningful projects that make a difference.
