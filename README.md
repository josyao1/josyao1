## About Me 📚

My name is Joshua. I am a sophomore at Northwestern University, pursuing a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science with a Minor in Economics. My interests in the computer science world are more in the back-end software development field as well as the Data Science/Analytics field.

My curiosity in Computer Science stems from a love for puzzle solving and out-of-the box thinking. The opportunity to tackle real-world challenges and help others through software engineering by applying my strong programming skills, analytical mindset, and data-driven problem-solving approach is both inspiring and motivational to me, and I'm excited to tackle any future projects!

**Experienced Programming Languages/Libraries**: Python, Pandas, Altair, Tensorflow, Keras, Java 
</br>**Intermediate Programming Languages/Softwares**: SQL, C++, R, HTML, Tableau, Racket, Scala
